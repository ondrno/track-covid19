# track-covid19
python program to track the covid-19 infection rate in different countries.

This program collects Corona ``SARS-CoV-2`` infection statistics for DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), 
the United Kingdom, and the United States on a daily basis. It collects the overall numbers of confirmed infections, 
people recovered (Austria only), and deaths twice a day. 

- Austria's numbers are based on information from the  
[Sozialministerium](https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html).
- Germany's numbers are based on information from the [Robert-Koch-Institute](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html).
- Switzerland's numbers are based on information from the [Bundesamt f√ºr Gesundheit BAG](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/situation-schweiz-und-international.html)
- United Kingdom's numbers are based on information from [GOV.uk](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e5fd11150d274bebaaf8fe2a7a2bda11)
- United State's numbers are based on information from [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html)
 

The aim of the program is to have a timeline how the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread in these countries.
  
## How to use
I have prepared a docker image for the ease of use. It provides a python/dash web application on port '8050' 
which shows the statistics found in the log file. The log file is continuously updated every 4 hours.

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose -d up
    
The log file ``cov19_statistics.log`` can be found in the ``log`` directory.
    
## Log file 
The log file is from version v2.0.0 onwards in json format. For every country it contains 
the number of cases ("c") and the number of deaths ("d") at a certain time ("date").

Further, it may contain further information about the number of cases and death of certain 
provinces of that country.  

Example:

    {"country": "DE", "c": 48582, "d": 325, "date": "2020-03-28T19:27:00"}
    {"country": "AT", "provinces": {"BL": {"c": 142, "d": 2}, "K": {"c": 221, "d": 2}, "NO": {"c": 1332, "d": 4}, "OO": {"c": 1332, "d": 4}, "SB": {"c": 751, "d": 4}, "ST": {"c": 828, "d": 17}, "T": {"c": 1846, "d": 9}, "V": {"c": 549, "d": 1}, "W": {"c": 1046, "d": 16}}, "c": 7995, "d": 68, "date": "2020-03-28T19:27:00"}
    {"country": "CH", "c": 13213, "d": 235, "date": "2020-03-28T19:27:00"}
    {"country": "UK", "c": 17089, "d": 1019, "date": "2020-03-28T19:27:00"}
    {"country": "US", "c": 85356, "d": 1246, "date": "2020-03-28T19:27:00"}
